The offer email arrived her inbox at 10:09pm, at a chilling late October Friday night. Lilian printed, signed, scanned, attached, checked the spellings, and hit "Send".  Hearing the Apple mail "whoosh" sound, we were both relieved. We hugged.

After one year of sweat and tear, she officially landed her first developer job. She did it. We did it.

In this post, you would hear our journey. Before 2018, she'd never written a line of javascript code in her life. Now she knows more CSS and React than me. I hope you can find inspirations from our story.

## The plan was to become a teacher
My wife has a Master of Education degree from Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE), University of Toronto. She's trained to teach. But living in Ontario, things are not that easy. To be certified as a teacher, she would go through [another four semester teacher program](https://www.oct.ca/becoming-a-teacher/requirements). After that, she might sit in the [school daily occasional teacher roster list](http://behindthenumbers.ca/2019/02/15/seniority-and-occasional-teacher-qualifications-understanding-regulation-274/), like an on-call sub, ready to cover absences in public schools, before she reaches enough seniority and gets hired as a long term teacher. This process takes years in Ontario.

Considering the opportunity costs of teaching in public schools, she started her teaching career at a private language school. She taught adults both English and Mandarin. Her boss was a senior lady who was super passionate about teaching, and spent her last 20 years running her school.

Truth be told, it wasn't a well-run school. It was mostly catered for professionals who either had an urgent business needs, or out of complete personal interests. It was still a niche market. Because it was for full-time professionals, all the classes are mostly scheduled at night.

Her job usually started from noon and lasted all the way until 9:30pm. During this time, she would speak non-stop in 3-4 back-to-back classes. At some point, she had throat issues and I tried to not let talk any more when she got home.

The pay was shitty. With the amount, she would barely afford a one-bedroom condo in downtown Toronto.

After one year, she's tired of teaching there, and decided to make a change.

The first thing she did was an EdTech startup, a company who provides coaching services for international undergraduates. She was hired as a Customer Success specialist.

Had I known how crazy the job was, I would absolutely not let her take that job.

As a CX, she needed to deal with tons of enquiries from clients, mostly parents and students, who live in different countries in opposite timezones and know little about American or Canadian universities.

Because of time zone differences, she often answered calls late and had to patiently coach students and explain to parents on the phone while gathering information about tens of programs requirements from tens of North American universities. 

Our quality of life quickly deteriorated. I listened to her complaining how demanding parents brought up ridiculous requests, like asking her to figure out their son's relationship status, requesting professors to postpone assignment deadlines.

The churn rate was high. Six month after she left, she wouldn't recognize anyone in the same CX team.

After three months, she had enough. And I was totally onboard with that decision.

## Switching wasn't easy.

One time we were in a friends gathering and chatted about each other's job. Most of our friends were one or two years into their career. They would share the findings about the industry, their boss, and co-workers gossip. It was like a honeymoon period. The tones were positive. 

Lilian looked at her phone for most of the night, showing no sign of willingness to join this kind of conversation. Her face was expressionless, only reflecting the screen light.

The gathering was over. We headed to our car. Right after she got into the front seat and I was about to start the engine, she burst out crying.

"Why is everyone having better job than me? What did I do wrong?"

"Don't think like that. Okay? You are not bad..." I was a bit shocked and didn't know what to react.

"No! I hate my job. I hate those the demanding parents. Why would I end up like this?"

"Oh, every job has its own sh*tty side. We need to learn to cope this. Right?"

"I hate the kind of conversations with my colleagues! All the gossip. All useless chip-chat. I see no hope. No hope, you know." 

"It wasn't that bad, right?"

"What did I do to deserve this type of sh*tty treatment?" Two streams of tears formed in her cheeks.

I opened the glove compartment and passed her the tissue box. 

It was an emotional moment. I didn't know better ways to comfort her, other than a few soft and supportive words. 

I didn't have a concrete solution for her problem, either. It was best to just listen quietly.

I started the car and drove the car into the highway.

She started sobbing, like a little girl who got hurt. The cruel world has treated her unfairly.

"Hey Lilian, you wanna try coding? You don't have to deal with clients. And the pay is decent, too." This idea suddenly came to mind.

"Making websites? I'm 27 now. It's too late."

"Well, at least you didn't hate it when you were having that part time class. I think you are good at visuals. Why not learn how to build the things you can imagine?"

"My mom said nobody in our family has become a programmer before. We are not good at math either. I have no confidence in it."

"You have nothing to lose. Just take a class and try it. Trying it won't harm you anyway. After three months, if you are still not sure, then we can decide to try something else. How about that?"

"But where do I start?"

"Easy. I can teach some basic stuffs. There are also plenty of online courses. Let's do some research after we get home."

"But what about rent? I won't be able to bring home any money if I quit my job."

"I'll take care of the rent. Don't worry about it."

I was quite motivated, partly because I'd like her to learn something about what I do for a living. Even dabbling in a little scripting, or some knowledge about web pages can be beneficial. 

Also, from what I know about Lilian, she's not a dumb person. She just picked the wrong major at university.

As Paul Graham puts it, "When you're young, you're given the impression that you'll get enough information to make each choice before you need to make it. But this is certainly not so with work. When you're deciding what to do, you have to operate on ridiculously incomplete information. Even in college you get little idea what various types of work are like."

Yeah, don't let life chosen by a high-school kid.

## How to tell if it's a fit

Some people has good taste for certain things. It just flows naturally. I could never acquire those tastes without spending efforts.

Lilian's taste for fashion, shopping, apartment decor, and many other things, always awes me. With just one glance, she could single out one outfit, among hundreds of others in ten aisles, and it suits me perfectly. I've learned to put myself in silence mode and not offer any of my opinion when she was walking the Uniqlo aisles.

From my intuition, she might enjoy making visuals stuffs. Web front end could be one subject. It's something that she could apply and see the outcome right away.

Also, part-time front end course is my canary test. Signing her up for a full-time bootcamp was risky. What if she didn't enjoy making websites? One part time course later, and I would find out. My hope was that, with my help and encouragement, she would find programming a joy, and rewarding, too.

## Part-time web dev courses

After some research, I signed her up for part-time courses in HackerYou College (renamed to Juno later in 2019).

The first course was about HTML/CSS and also a little Javascript. Twice a week. The classes were on Tuesday and Thursday nights. I drove to pick her up after class almost every night.

On our drive home, she would share with me what she learned that night, and what technical questions she would need my help.

During the first two months, she learned the basics about HTML, CSS, and little Javascript. 

For a newbie who never wrote code before, that was already pretty fast already. The part time courses gave more confidence about coding.

My judgement was right. She was quite interested in building visual widgets, combining a few of her favourite colours and made sleek, modern landing pages. 

What surprised me was that, she was also interested in reasoning about layouts.

"It reminds me of the high school geometry, where I got to do simple math and control the position of the shapes. It was such a cool thing to make visual effects with smart CSS tricks." That's her own words.

## Coding bootcamp

The part time course ended. She couldn't wait to learn more. So I signed her up for [the coding bootcamp](https://junocollege.com/bootcamp/).

During the first few weeks, I would use my working knowledge to help her about HTML and CSS. But her CSS knowledge advanced fast. After about one month and a half, she could make visual widgets that would take me a while to figure out.

Some of the sties she made can be found here: https://linlinghao.com

What's shocked to me is she took notes by hand. Seriously hand written notes by hand.

She pretty much wrote down everything she learned about HTML / CSS. This type of old-school learning habit, I haven't used for a long time.

I thought it was inefficient at first, because writing is slow, and we have so much technical documentation. Why would we still need handwriting? Seems like a last century thing.

But it helped her memory. Since she'd written down, she remembered. Whenever there was question, she could quickly open up her notebook, and pointed it to me, and started the discussion. If there's anything incorrect, she could make corrections on that page. Seeing her highlight this line, and use a different colour to add anther footnote, I realized it was a habit that persists information in a primitive yet tangible way. For people with organized handwriting, this is quite effective.

One particular example is the javascript execution environment. She drew it out:

She referred to it multiple times when she was learning objects, scope, callbacks, event loops.

Javascript is a beast. It needs experience to fully understand why things evolve to the current shape. And there is no remedy to lack of experience than increasing exposure to more programs.

After almost two weeks of studying at home (she quit her job and stayed home), and watching online videos (I bought her quite a few JS courses on Udemy), she finally come to appreciate Javascript. She would not insist CSS is so power.

The bootcamp progressed fast. The curriculum assumed people have backgrounds in HTML and CSS. So they only went over the advanced topics in HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript in two weeks, and started teaching React in Week 3. 

It was a crazy pace. Some of her classmates would barely write a Javascript function, or explain what is an object. And they started talking about React components and ES6.

For the first month, we spent many nights going over React component, and how it translates to vanilla javascript code, and the design thinking behind all of them. I think my explanation greatly helped her study.

During the first few months, some of her classmates quit. And she was more comfortable with ES6. When it was time build her third milestone projects, she could already build components with ES6 and started learning Redux to manage the state. 

It was almost surreal to hear her saying Redux was such a thorough and organized way to manage states, and she could never go back to the barbarian time.

It wasn't without drawbacks, though. One thing that was particularly hard for her was Javascript asynchronous programs. I tried to explain to why there is await / async keywords. It was to make async programs look synchronous like.

Also, jumping from CSS to javascript, she just couldn't understand why would javascript has such abstract concepts like objects or functions, and why she couldn't see what the program does. Printing logs with console.log() was not interesting at all. She could't see using javascript to implement dazzling visual effects like CSS. 

I would not blame her. As a programming newbie, this is a first time she's encountering async. Two weeks ago, she probably didn't what an object was. Now I had to mention to her something about Promise.

Knowing that, I was particularly patient. And tried my best to use different ways to explain to her why people invent this. What problems async was designed to solve. When I saw her confused, I suggest her to let it go for now, and everything makes more sense when she learns more frameworks, like jquery, and React.

At Week 9, she submitted her final project submission. It was a flashcard app built with Stackoverflow API. It was built with React and Redux. For the user auth, it was delegated to Firebase auth. She even built a Chrome extension for it. It was an end to end delivery. 

Can't believe she had made this far.

## Concluding thoughts

I'm grateful to have married such a determined partner who pulled this off. It was easy, or cheap.

The biggest lesson I learned is that, people need to try and find out what they like. 

Err on the actions side, and create something, whether it's an app, an experience, a business.

When decided to try, a strategy to handle uncertainty, like starting with a part-time courses, is also needed. Sometimes people need to juggle  the resources / time / money / connections they have. The trick is know when to stop before you get analysis paralysis.

Start trying!
