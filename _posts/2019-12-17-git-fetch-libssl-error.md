*UPDATE: If you are having issue with `libssl.1.0.0.dylib` instead of `libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib` (mind the difference), please try the solution in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59184347/8175889): `brew switch openssl 1.0.2t`.*

Recently, Homebrew drops OpenSSL v1.0 for v1.1. The popular [TagUI Github
issue](https://github.com/kelaberetiv/TagUI/issues/86) suggests downgrading
openssl to v1.0 because their stack hasn't support v1.1 yet. But that's not a
good idea in general. This posts presents my solution to the specific issue I saw.

When I reinstalled openssl v1.1, git suddently not working:

```shell
$ git fetch origin
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/ssh
  Reason: image not found
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

When you read the message, it was quite clear: `ssh` is not working. My solution is as simple as

```shell
brew upgrade openssh
```

The new openssh version works fine with openssl v1.1
```shell
$ brew info openssh                                                                                                                                             [10:29:34]
